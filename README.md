# Edu-AR
Our platform allows educators to improve learning outcomes through increased engagement and interactivity. Augmented Reality in education features aspects that enhance the learning of abilities like problem-solving, collaboration, and creation to better prepare students for the future. Our platform will enable the teachers to improve the understanding of abstract, spatial geometric concepts through manipulation and multi-angle observation of virtual 3D objects for the students.
